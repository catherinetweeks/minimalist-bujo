**Minimalist Bujo - Your Digital Bullet Journal**
-------------------------------------------------

This clean and responsive web app is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, edit and delete entries of two types: tasks and notes. To go along with the minimalist aesthetic it has few but important features including:

*   Create entries (tasks and notes)
    
*   Tasks, displayed with a checkbox, can be completed
    
*   Add titles descriptions and due dates to entries
    
*   Edit and delete entries
    
*   Sorting and filtering entries by date and completed status
    
*   Storing entries in memory locally - no need to sign in
    
*   Striking and minimalist design that includes rounded task cards, modals and hover animations that make the app feel fun, yet simple and responsive
    

**Tools Used**

*   React
    
*   Typescript
    
*   Tailwind CSS
    
*   Framer motion
    
*   Vite

**Why I built this!**

I wanted to practice designing and building the front-end of a web application. As much as I love the concept of bullet journaling, I wanted something cleaner and digital, that didn't have an overwhelming amount of features but was still a pleasure to use. This solo project was initially done to gain experience with Typescript and React, but I learned so much more about responsive design and project management than I thought I would.
